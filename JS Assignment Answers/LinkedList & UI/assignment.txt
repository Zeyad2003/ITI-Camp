Build a linked list data structure with JS using classes and its core methods:

- peek(): returns the value of the head node without removing it from the list.
- insert(value): adds a new node with the specified value to the end of the list.
- remove(): removes the head node from the list and returns its value.
- isEmpty(): returns true if the list is empty, otherwise false.
- length(): returns the number of nodes in the list.
- reverse(): reverses the order of the nodes in the list.

Provide a UI with html, css, and js to interact with the linked list and demonstrate its functionality.
Each node will have a different color.
