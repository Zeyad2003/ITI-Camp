"""
Python (the language standard):

        - Python itself is not a single program.

        - It’s a specification: rules for syntax, semantics, and libraries (like a recipe book).

        - These rules are maintained through PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals).

                Example: PEP 8 → style guide.   

                Example: PEP 484 → type hints.   

Python Implementations:
        - default implementation for the standard:
                        CPython.

        - IronPython: C#
        - Jython: Java
        - Cython: python compiled into C. C-types
        - PyPy: python (RPython)
